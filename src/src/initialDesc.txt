Introduction
============

Welcome to the WDTE playground, a browser based evaluation
environment for WDTE. This playground's features includes the
standard function set as well as a number of importable modules.

If you have never seen WDTE before and are completely confused at
the moment, try reading the overview on the WDTE project's wiki:
https://github.com/DeedleFake/wdte/wiki

For documentation on the standard function set, see
https://godoc.org/github.com/DeedleFake/wdte/std

The standard library is available for importing, with the exception of the `io` and `io/file` modules, pending [gopherjs/gopherjs#705][gopherjs-problem]. As a partial workaround for the lack of the `io` module, a `print` function is provided in the top-level scope which just passes its first argument through to `fmt.Println()` and then returns the argument.
