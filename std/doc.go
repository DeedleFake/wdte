// Package std provides a number of basic WDTE functions.
//
// The functions provided by this package are slightly different from
// those in many of the standard library's packages in that they are
// intended to be directly inserted into the top-level scope, rather
// than imported. They provide basic functionality, such as addition
// and subtraction, as well as some more language-specific
// functionality, such as the ability to check the type of a value.
